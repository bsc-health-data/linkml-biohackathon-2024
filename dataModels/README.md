- [Phenopackets](https://github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-schema): Represents an open standard for sharing disease and phenotype information to improve our ability to understand, diagnose, and treat both rare and common diseases. A Phenopacket links detailed phenotypic descriptions with disease, patient, and genetic information.
