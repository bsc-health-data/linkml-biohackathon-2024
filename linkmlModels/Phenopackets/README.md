# Phenopackets LinkML model

The linkML model is extracted from [this](https://github.com/cmungall/linkml-phenopackets/) repository.

The main linkML .yaml file can be found in the [schema folder](https://github.com/cmungall/linkml-phenopackets/tree/main/src/phenopackets/schema) with the main [phenopackets](https://github.com/cmungall/linkml-phenopackets/blob/main/src/phenopackets/schema/phenopackets.yaml) file as a root.

To test the data, many examples can be found [here](https://github.com/cmungall/linkml-phenopackets/tree/main/examples).
